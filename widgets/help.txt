Welcome to Invoice Extractor  help!

Invoice Extractor is a deep neural network to extract intelligent information from invoice documents.

Invoice Extractor has a lot to offer. Here is a small description of some of the tools you will have to your disposal.

---

Open Files:

The 'Open Files' function allows you to open one or multiple files into InvoiceNet.

On clicking the button, you're prompted with a dialog box where you can select all the files (PDF, PNG, JPG) you want to open. Once you're done, you can cycle through each document in the list and extract information from each document.

PDF files are opened directly into the viewer. However, when an image file is opened, Google's OCR, Tesseract, is ran on the image in order to extract readable text.

Open Directory:

The 'Open Directory' function works in the same way as the 'Open Files' function, but it allows you to open all files inside a particular directory in a single shot.

---

Set Save Directory:

The 'Set Save Directory' function allows you to set the directory where extracted information will be saved when 'Save Information' button is clicked.

---

Clear Page:

The 'Clear Page' option lets you clear any modification you made to the current page.

---

Next/Previous File:

The 'Next File' and 'Previous File' options allow you to cycle through the list of files that were opened using InvoiceNet.

---

Viewer:

The Page Tool Bar gives you functions to manipulate your documents.
- Use the 'Next Page' and 'Previous Page' buttons to cycle through the different pages in your invoice.
- Use the 'Last Page' and 'First Page' buttons to directly go to the pages on the extreme ends.
- Use the 'Zoom In', 'Zoom Out' and 'Fit-To-Screen' buttons to make the current page bigger or smaller.
- Use the 'Rotate' button to rotate pages.

Extract:

Before extracting information from an invoice, you need to select the fields that should be extracted. The field checkboxes become active automatically if InvoiceNet is able to find a trained model for a field.

After selecting the fields to be extracted, click on the 'Extract' button and InvoiceNet will try to extract those fields from the current invoice and display the extracted information in the logging space.

---

Save Information:

After information extraction, the logging space will show you the extracted fields in the form of a python dictionary. You can edit the extracted fields here if there are any discrepancies.

Once you are done, click on the 'Save Information' button and InvoiceNet will save your extracted information as a JSON file. If a JSON file with the same name already exists, the newly extracted fields will be added to this file.
